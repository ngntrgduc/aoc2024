My take onÂ [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024). I played this in the month before my final, so there were days I didn't finish (or due to my skill issues, for sure).

Update on day 16: I was tired of 2D-array problems + lots of deadlines were coming, so I dropped it.

### Stuff I learned/revisited

Algorithm
<!-- - Topological sort (Day 5, part 2) -->
- Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Day 6, part 2)

Python
- Better understanding on `copy` module, deep copy (deepcopy()) and swallow copy (copy())

Other
- RegEx: Group capturing
